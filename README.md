# Event_Driven_Progamming_Project
I have made a project based on using event driven programming style of coding to create a lecture scheduling app which has a client(s) connect to a server and put in requests which the server handles and returns.
The server has been coded to handle multiple clients so that if 1 client makes a change, the rest of the clients will also see this change. This is done via multi-threading.
The GUI has buttons for all methods i was asked to do which includes a Add lecture, Delete lecture, View schedule and Request Earlier lecture(s).
My part in this Two person project was to work on the general logic behind the methods while my partner would then implement these into a working GUI buttons and make the GUi look presentable.
This was tested on the IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2.3 on Windows 11.
